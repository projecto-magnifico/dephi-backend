        "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Sen. John McCain, a former Navy pilot and prisoner of war during Vietnam, issued a veiled criticism of President Donald Trump's medical deferments that kept him from serving in the U.S. military during the conflict. In an interview with C-SPAN that aired Sunday, the six-term Arizona lawmaker lamented that the military \"drafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say they had a bone spur.\" One of Trump's five draft deferments came as a result of a physician's letter stating he suffered from bone spurs in his feet. Trump's presidential campaign described the issue as a temporary problem.",
